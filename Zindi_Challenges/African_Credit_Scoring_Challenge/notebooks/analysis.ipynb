    "# African Credit Score Prediction Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt:\n",
    "Financial institutions need to predict loan defaults to mitigate risk and optimise lending decisions. In Africa’s rapidly growing financial markets, with diverse customer demographics and dynamic economic conditions, accurately assessing default risk is more important than ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we want you to develop a robust, generalisable machine learning model to `predict the likelihood of loan defaults for both existing customers and new applicants.` Beyond accurate predictions, `we encourage yous to innovate by incorporating unique factors relevant to each financial market`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that accurately `predicts the probability of loan default.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 10 winners, in addition to submitting their solution, `will need to design and submit a credit scoring function, using their model's outputs and probabilities. This step involves binning model outputs into risk categories and proposing a scalable credit risk score.`\n",
    "\n",
    "By accurately predicting loan defaults, your work will enable the client organisation to create a credit scoring solution to evaluate risk more effectively, improving decision-making, reducing financial losses associated with high-risk lending, and allowing for expansion into new financial markets.\n",
    "The challenge provider is a private asset manager that operates in several financial markets across Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points\n",
    "- Predict likelihoold of loan default for new and existing applicants\n",
    "- Incorporate unique factors relevant to each financial market (**Kenya and Ghana ??**)\n",
    "- Credit scoring function (**probability of default**)\n",
    "- Kenya (train and test set) and Ghana (test set)"

    "## About Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with loan and customer data from Kenya (train and test set) and Ghana (test set). This split emphasises the need for models that generalise well, i.e. perform well across different countries and financial contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that a customer ID can appear in multiple rows of the dataset, and for a given customer, a loan ID can also appear with different lender IDs. For example, we can have the same customer ID on three rows with the same loan ID on each but a different lender ID. This observation means that the loan is funded by three separate lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional data pulled from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) portal are provided to enrich model performance and offer insights into features that impact on credit scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic indicators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG: Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)<br/>\n",
    "PA.NUS.FCRF: Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) <br/>\n",
    "FR.INR.RINR: Real interest rate (%)<br/>\n",
    "AG.LND.PRCP.MM: Average precipitation in depth (mm per year)<br/>\n",
    "FR.INR.DPST: Deposit interest rate (%)<br/>\n",
    "FP.INR.LEND: Lending interest rate (%)<br/>\n",
    "FR.INR.LNDP: Interest rate spread (lending rate minus deposit rate, %<br/>\n",
    "EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS: Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)<br/>\n",
    "SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS: Unemployment rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The data downloaded from FRED is saved in a separate CSV in the data section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of variables in Train/Test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **ID**: A unique identifier for each entry in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **country_id**: Identifier or code representing the `country where the customer resides or where the loan was issued`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **tbl_loan_id**: Unique identifier for each loan associated with the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Total_Amount**: The total loan amount initially disbursed to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Total_Amount_to_Repay**: The total amount the customer is expected to repay, including principal, interest, and fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **loan_type**: The category or type of loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **disbursement_date**: The date when the loan amount was disbursed to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **duration**: The length of the loan term, typically expressed in days\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **lender_id**: Unique identifier for the lender or institution that issued the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **New_versus_Repeat**: Indicates whether the loan is the customer's first loan (\"New\") or if the customer has taken loans before (\"Repeat\").\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Amount_Funded_By_Lender**: The portion of the loan funded directly by the lender.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Lender_portion_Funded**: Percentage of the total loan amount funded by the lender.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **due_date**: The date by which the loan repayment is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Lender_portion_to_be_repaid**: The portion of the outstanding loan that needs to be repaid to the lender.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **target**: This variables takes the value 0 or 1. 1 means the customer defaulted on the loan, whereas 0 means, the customer paid the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points:\n",
    "- Customer data from `Kenya (train and test set)` and Ghana `(test set)`\n",
    "- We can have the same customer ID on three rows with the same loan ID on each but a different lender ID.\n",
